# Code Generation Step in Compiler

## Introduction

This report explains the code generation step in a compiler. The code generation step is a crucial part of the compiler, where the compiler generates machine code that can be executed by the target machine. In this report, we will go through the code provided and explain how the code generation step is implemented.

## Code Provided

The code provided includes several files, including codeGen.c, codeGen.h, and file.y. These files contain the code required for the code generation step of the compiler.

### codeGen.c

The codeGen.c file contains functions that are responsible for generating machine code. The functions include:

-   creerEnt: This function creates a new entry in the code table, which includes the code, the operand, and the function name.
-   creerOp: This function creates a new entry in the code table with a given code and operand.
-   creerCode: This function creates a new entry in the code table with a given code and no operand.
-   genererCode: This function generates the machine code by writing the entries in the code table to a file.

### codeGen.h

The codeGen.h file contains the data structures used in the code generation step, including the ENTREE_CODE structure, which contains the code, operand, and function name.

### miniJava.y

The miniJava.y file contains the main function, which coordinates the code generation step by calling the BeginCodeGen() function to initialize the code table, yyparse() to start the parsing process, and the EndCodeGen() function to generate the machine code.

## Implementation

The code generation step is implemented by first creating entries in the code table using the creerEnt(), creerOp(), and creerCode() functions. These entries include the code and operand or function name, which are then stored in the code table.

Once all the entries have been created and stored in the code table, the EndCodeGen() function is called to generate the machine code by writing the entries in the code table to a file using the genererCode() function.

## Conclusion

The code generation step is a crucial part of the compiler that generates machine code that can be executed by the target machine. The code provided includes functions that create entries in the code table and generate machine code by writing the entries to a file.
